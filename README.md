### Hello there 👋🏽

#### Intro
Welcome! I'm Ashar (yes, pronounced like the [rapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(musician))), a software engineer during the day and someone who spends his evenings [folding clothes while people are still in them](https://erickchen.com/2020/05/19/day-23-jiu-jitsu-the-gentle-art-of-folding-clothes-while-people-are-still-in-them/). When I'm not working or at the gym, you'll probably find me mindlessly scrolling through social media, or on rare occasion, trying to finally get past page 10 of [**The Brothers Karamazov**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov).
